# This input file is used by the Master App. With this configuration,
# the Master App does not perform any actual solves - it just facilitates
# solution transfers. This test fully-couples OpenMC and BISON, using a
# zeroth order Legendre expansion and a second-order Zernike expansion.
# Note that at this point, OpenMC does not have Zernike-Legendre expansions,
# but _only_ Zernike expansions, so there is a constant scaling factor that
# is incorrect for this coupling, but the mechanics are correct.

# In order to transfer a continuous field variable to BISON, we need to
# have solve = true in order to get the AuxKernels to evaluate. But, we
# dont need to perform a _nonlinear_ solve, so we can set no kernels for
# the dummy variable "u".
