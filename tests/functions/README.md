The tests in this section demonstrate the correct implementation of the soon-to-be deprecated FE capabilites in aprilnovak/moose/fe-module-deprecated. Correct transitioning to the MOOSE functional_expansion_tools module can be assertained by verifying that similarly-constructed input files match the gold files in this directory for the different function types tested here (as of writing this, the functional_expansion_tools module only has Zernike polynomials, I believe).
